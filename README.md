# looper 
it's a functional looper, although not a particularly good one, as I haven't yet put the time in to figure out how to sync everything to a beat. Still, it's a looper, by god.

I think i limited myself somewhat by using Recorder.js, but ah well


Go check out the much better [Looper.js](https://github.com/lautr3k/Looper.js)!
